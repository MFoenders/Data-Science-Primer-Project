# Data-Science-Primer-Project: Hangman Game

Welcome to my Hangman project! This project was developed during the primer phase of my Data Science journey, where I was introduced to Python. It's a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Hangman game, designed to demonstrate foundational programming concepts in Python.

## About the Project üéØ

The Hangman project is a text-based version of the classic word-guessing game. It's built using Python and showcases basic programming skills, including loops, conditionals, and data structure manipulation. This project was an exciting way to apply and reinforce my understanding of Python in the early stages of my Data Science Bootcamp.

## Features üåü

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can guess letters to reveal the hidden word.
- **Limited Guesses**: The game limits the number of incorrect guesses to increase the challenge.
- **Dynamic Word Selection**: Each game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, ensuring a unique experience every time.
- **User Input Validation**: The game checks for valid input and provides feedback for incorrect or repeated guesses.

## How to Play üïπÔ∏è

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `hangman.py` script in a Python environment.
3. The game will display a series of blanks representing the letters of a hidden word.
4. Guess letters one at a time. Correct guesses will reveal their positions in the word.
5. Be careful! Incorrect guesses bring you closer to losing. You only have a limited number of wrong guesses.
6. The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of guesses.

## Technologies Used üíª

- **Python**: The entire game is written in Python, showcasing basic syntax and programming concepts.

## Reflections and Learning Outcomes üìö

Developing the Hangman game was a valuable experience in my early Data Science learning path. It helped me understand the practical applications of Python and improved my problem-solving skills. This project laid the groundwork for more complex programming challenges ahead in my Data Science journey.
